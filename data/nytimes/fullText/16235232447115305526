BUCHAREST, Romania, Dec. 31 (Reuters) — Fireworks lighted the skies and thousands of people danced at street parties across Romania and Bulgaria on Sunday to celebrate the entry of the two former Soviet bloc countries into the European Union on Monday.

There was relief that, after missing the major European enlargement into Eastern Europe in 2004, the two countries had finally made the grade and been welcomed into a bloc that is increasingly hesitant to admit new members.

Hopes for prosperity and stability were echoed in the politicians’ speeches and the statements of local residents as blue and yellow European Union flags fluttered over Bucharest and Sofia.

“This is a moment of great freedom for us,” President Traian Basescu of Romania told crowds in University Square in Bucharest as they counted down the last minutes to midnight. “By entering the E.U., we win our peace and our prosperity.”

The accession of Romania and Bulgaria will raise the European Union’s membership to 27, almost half of them former Communist states cut off from the West until 1989.

Other European hopefuls like Turkey, Albania and states in the Balkans are likely to face a long wait for membership as some Western Europeans fear the bloc may have overstretched itself. Romania and Bulgaria together will increase the European Union’s population by 30 million, to 490 million, but will add just 1 percent to its economic output.
