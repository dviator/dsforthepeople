A man suffered burns from his chin to his nose while he was on an operating table on Nov. 29, and the cause of the fire is still unknown, The Waterbury Republican-American reported yesterday, citing a new report from the cityâ€™s acting fire marshal. The patient, Jose Adorno, 60, of Waterbury, was burned at Waterbury Hospital. Hospital officials have said a piece of equipment malfunctioned and caused a flash fire. Chet Bennett, the acting fire marshal, told The Republican-American that the department was unable to determine a cause because the room had been cleaned after the fire.
