Tina Charles scored 15 points and had 11 rebounds as No. 5 Connecticut defeated visiting Sacred Heart, 82-40 yesterday, giving Coach Geno Auriemma his 600th career victory.

Kaili McLaren, making her first start, also had a double-double, scoring 14 points and grabbing 15 rebounds for the Huskies (11-0), who shrugged off a sluggish start for their 192nd consecutive win at home against unranked teams.

Auriemma, 52, is the 17th women’s coach to reach the 600-win milestone. He is the fastest to reach the mark, doing so in 716 games over 22 seasons.

“It’s kind of like a wave,” Auriemma said. “It just keeps coming and coming and coming. It’s carrying me, as opposed to me having any effect on it, it’s just the momentum of the program has taken me forward to all these wins.”

Sacred Heart (6-6) was led by guard Amanda Pape, who had 19 points, and became the team’s career scoring leader with 1,535.
