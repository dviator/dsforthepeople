HONG KONG, Dec. 31 (AP) — Hong Kong will become a mostly smoke-free city starting Monday, when a ban on smoking in many public spaces — inside and outdoors — goes into effect.

The ban covers restaurants, workplaces, schools and karaoke lounges, and even extends to places like beaches, sports grounds and large swaths of public parks.

The strict antismoking laws are extremely rare in Asia, which has some of the heaviest smoking populations in the world. Among the continent’s major cities, Singapore is the only one with a similar law.

Hong Kong’s legislators passed the new law in October after a marathon 12-hour debate. The stiffest opposition came from the restaurant and entertainment industry.

Amy Choi, 27, a law student, said she supported the smoking ban because she hated breathing secondhand smoke, even though she enjoys smoking when she drinks. “I don’t like people smoking next to me,” she said. “It’s so smoky and smelly.”

Robert Hyde, an Australian tourist who has smoked for more than 10 years, said the ban would not stop him from returning to Hong Kong. “If I need to smoke, then I’ll smoke outside the restaurant and then go back to enjoy my meal,” he said. “It’s easy.”

But Leung Kwok-hung, a lawmaker who opposed the measure, said a complete ban was unnecessary. “Smoking is not permitted in many of the outdoor areas,” he said. “The coverage is so large, but the smoking area is so limited.”

Mr. Leung said the government should have allowed businesses to install filtration and ventilation systems that keep air clean inside.

“It’s ridiculous that the government is not allowing restaurateurs to use those enhancement facilities to maintain a smoking area in their restaurants,” he said. “They should be given a choice.”

Hong Kong’s ban does not yet include nightclubs, bars, mah-jongg parlors, bathhouses or massage establishments. They have until July 1, 2009, to carry out the law.
